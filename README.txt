A few sources were used during the development of ShipWrecked.

1.) http://www.javacoffeebreak.com/text-adventure/
 
   - was used as an aid during the building of the Skeleton code.
	- helped me get the basics of a text adventure figured out and the development of all of the classes

2.) several online forums and of course the subreddit  
   
   - the rest of my sources were used to help with any small problems that I ran into while developing the game
